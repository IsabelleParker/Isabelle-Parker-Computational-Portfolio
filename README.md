# Computational-Portfolio
---
### Synopsis

This portfolio contains a number of computational physics modeling projects.
These projects investigate a variety of physics topics, including:

- Modeling A Diatomic Ideal Gas
- Quantifying Differences between Classical and Relativistic Accelerations
- Investigating Coupled Oscillators
- Observing Effects of External Forces on Orbiting Satellites

In addition, each project uses a variety of tools, including:

- matplotlib
- numpy
- scipy
- Euler/RK2/RK4 Methods of solving ODEs

The difficulty of the physics concepts displayed in these projects is at the college undergraduate level.
Each project was written in Python, and commented/formatted in a way that the reader will find all required background and assumptions made throughout the project.

### Projects

Below are links to the Jupyter Notebook of each project along with a short description of the project. A more in-depth description is contained within the Notebook.

[Diatomic Ideal Gas Modeling](./Project0/Diatomic_Gas_Model.ipynb) - While monatomic gas particles are studied and simulated quite often, especially in undergraduate physics courses, diatomic gas molecules are only discussed in the form of challenge problems in textbooks. This notebook, while not perfect, makes an attempt to model diatomic gas particles as rotors to produce accurate particle-wall and particle-particle collisions.

[Classical and Relativistic Acceleration](./Project1/IsabelleProj01.ipynb) - The jump from the classical behaviors of movement and acceleration taught in introductory physics to realtivistic effects taught in classes such as Modern Physics can be challenging for some students. This notebook walks through classical and relativistic models with the basis of a small mass experiencing a constant acceleration. 

[Investgating Coupled Oscillators](./Project3/IsabelleProj03.ipynb) - Oscillators are a concept covered extensively throughout most, if not all physics courses. This notebook starts with a chain of coupled oscillators, and walks through how the change of various parameters can affect the fundamental frequency of the chain.

[Effects of Solar Winds on Orbiting Satellites](./ProjectFinal/PHY2200Final.ipynb) - This notebook walks through the effects of outside forces on the orbits of satellite, in this case, solar winds.
Numerical integration is used to find the postion of the satellite over time, as well as allow for tracking of the total energy of the satellite to determine if an orbit it is in is stable or not.
