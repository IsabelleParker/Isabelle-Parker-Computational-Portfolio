# Computational-Portfolio
---
### Synopsis

This portfolio contains a number of computational physics modeling projects.
These projects investigate a variety of physics topics, including:

- Modeling A Diatomic Ideal Gas
- Quantifying Differences between Classical and Relativistic Accelerations
- Investigating Coupled Oscillators
- Observing Effects of External Forces on Orbiting Satellites

In addition, each project uses a variety of tools, including:

- matplotlib
- numpy
- scipy
- Euler/RK2/RK4 Methods of solving ODEs

The difficulty of the physics concepts displayed in these projects is at the college undergraduate level.
Each project was written in Python, and commented/formatted in a way that the reader will find all required background and assumptions made throughout the project.
